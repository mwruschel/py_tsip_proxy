py_tsip_proxy : a simple proxy for a Trimble Thunderbolt GPS

 *** WORK IN PROGRESS, CURRENTLY IT DOESN'T REALLY DO MUCH ***

This is a simple proxy so that several clients can talk to a Trimble
Thunderbolt GPS in parallel.

$ ./py_tsip_proxy.py  -h
usage: py_tsip_proxy.py [-h] [-l DEVICE] [-b BPS] [-t HOST] [-p PORT]
                        [-s PORT]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -l DEVICE, --serial_line DEVICE
                        Device to open, default /dev/ttyUSB0
  -b BPS, --serial_baud BPS
                        Serial port speed in bits per second.
  -t HOST, --tcp-host HOST
                        Hostname to connect to (via TCP, overrides serial)
  -p PORT, --tcp-port PORT
                        Port number for outbound tcp-connection.
  -s PORT, --server-port PORT
                        Port number for inbound tcp-connection.


Run on the device connected to your GPS' serial port as such:

   ./py_tsip_proxy.py -l /dev/ttyUSB0 -b 9600

...or, when the GPS is connected to a terminal server, at the given
address and port (in this example: host 192.168.2.134, port 4001):

   ./py_tsip_proxy.py -t 192.168.2.134 -p 4001

Then you can connect to the local machine running the proxy at port 4001.
This port can be changed using the "-s PORT" option.
